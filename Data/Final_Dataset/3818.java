/**
 * The classes in this package define how to layout the properties, collections and actions of a domain object - the
 * building blocks - as defined in the <code>members.v1</code> package.
 *
 * <p>
 *     The layout is modelled closely after <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, and is intended to
 *     support the grid layouts implemented by that CSS framework.  This flexibility comes at the cost of some
 *     verbosity.
