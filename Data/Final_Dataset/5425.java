/**
 * Core domain model for the Thucydides application.
 * The core module contains the bulk of the Thucydides code. All the core domain modelling, reporting and
 * WebDriver support goes here. It is written in a test-framework-agnostic way, to make it easier to hock into
 * other testing or BDD frameworks.
 * These classes are usually used in conjunction with one of the other modules such as the JUnit or Easyb module,
 * to write the actual acceptance tests.
