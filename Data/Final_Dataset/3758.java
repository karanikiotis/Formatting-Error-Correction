/**
 * A type of {@link CheckoutException} that occurs in the "normal" flow of operations. Instances of this exception
 * can be treated as something that is meant to happen, without paying extra attention (as opposed to a
 * {@link CheckoutException} that is not an instance of this class).
 *
 * Examples: A user submits a second time the payment cancel form, effectively attempting to delete an order that is
 * already deleted. This is a regular checkout exception because we don't need to take additional measures besides
 * displaying an error message. This example can be opposed to the example of a payment gateway returning an error
 * linked to the global configuration of the gateway : in which case the error has to be logged and an administrator
 * informed.
