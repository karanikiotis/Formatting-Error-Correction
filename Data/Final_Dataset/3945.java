 * The MrGeo core code identifies plugins that support images by using the
 * Java ServiceLoader capabilities to find these classes. In order to enable
 * that mechanism to find the implementation, the plugin must include a file
 * named META-INF/services/org.mrgeo.data.image.MrsImageDataProviderFactory
 * in its JAR file. That file must be a text file with a line in it that
