/**
 * Facilitates communication with the Copycat cluster within the context of a session.
 * <p>
 * Clients communicate with the Copycat cluster within the context of a session. Sessions are used to
 * achieve linearizable semantics and first-in-first-out ordering of client operations by coordinating
 * {@link io.atomix.copycat.Command commands} and {@link io.atomix.copycat.Query queries} submitted by
 * the client to the cluster. Additionally, sessions facilitate listening for event notifications from
 * the cluster. When state changes occur in the server-side replicated state machine, state machines
 * can publish messages notifying the client of events. The session aids in guaranteeing sequential
 * and linearizable consistency for server-to-client communication.
